# RecipeHandler-4.0

## about this project

A Progressive Web App to collect, categorise and share recipes. The project serves as playground for upcoming, exciting web standards. So don't expect it to work in IE11 :scream:. This can easily be deployed to a new Firebase project. If you need help with that feel free to contact me. The extensive usage of firestore security rules combined with custom claims (JWT) enables user administration

> A running version of this app can be found here: https://recipehandler.web.app/
